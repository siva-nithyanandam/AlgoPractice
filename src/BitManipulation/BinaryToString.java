/**
 *  Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double,

 */

/**
 * First, letâ€™s start off by asking ourselves what a non-integer number in binary looks like.
 * By analogy to a decimal number, the binary number 0 .101 would look like:
 *
 * 0. 101 = (1 * 1/2) + (0 *1/4) + (1 * 1/8).
 *
 * So subtract the given decimal by 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and so on, when its greater than that and
 * append 1 in that case, or else append 0 and have given decimal as it is.
 *
 * And binary representation should not 31 places. If so, return ERROR.
